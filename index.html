        </h1>
        <p>Console is a debug menu for webpages. A debeug menu is  aplace where u can find erros and note thinks down to refer later. This helps in finding errors or seeing if some component is working or not.
            To access console, right cliek the page and click inspect option, then go to console tab. I have written a few thigns down there.
